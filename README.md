# Grocery List Analyzer (C++ Console Application)

## Overview

The Grocery List Analyzer is a C++ console application that reads input data from a file and provides analysis through a menu-driven interface. The program allows users to count occurrences of specific items, display all items with their frequencies, and visualize item frequency using a text-based histogram.

This project demonstrates core C++ programming skills including file input/output, structured program design, modular architecture, and deterministic data processing.

## Features

- Reads and processes input data from a text file  
- Counts occurrences of user-specified items  
- Displays frequency of all items in the input file  
- Generates a histogram visualization of item frequencies  
- Provides a menu-driven command-line interface  
- Uses modular design with header and implementation files  

---

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Input/Output (ifstream, ofstream)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Modular program design (.h and .cpp separation)

---

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates software engineering and systems programming concepts:

- C++ programming fundamentals
- File parsing and structured input processing
- Modular program architecture

## Example Functionality

The program provides options such as:

1. Search for an item frequency

2. Display all item frequencies

3. Display histogram

4. Exit program

Example output:
- Apples: 4
- Bananas: 2
- Oranges: 3

Histogram:
- Apples ****
- Bananas **
- Oranges ***
